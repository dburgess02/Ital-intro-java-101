//Print out welcom screen 
To print out a "Welcome screen" we would do a "system.out" command.

//instructions
A "system.out" command, saying "please guess a number between 1-23"
 
 //Show if the user was correct or not
 Now that we have displayed the welcome screen, and a set of instrucctions. We will now let the user know if their attempts was correct or not.
 In this situation we would use "if else" statement. If the conditions are true based on what the statement that has been typed are true, it should display a correct or incorrect as a message.
 
// Giving the user more than one try: 
Giving the user the ability to run the game more than once would require a for loop. 

//end
